# passim_pipeline_scripts
This repository contains Python scripts designed to enable independent execution of alto exports from eScriptorium on the passim library.

 alto_to_json :  This Python script performs data extraction and transformation from XML files and a text file, specifically tailored for creating JSONLines files suitable for Text-to-Text alignment using Passim.   
 
 json_to_alto :   This Python script is designed to manipulate XML files by updating the text content based on JSON data. Specifically, it is intended to update the content of XML files based on the results of text-to-text alignment performed using Passim.  
 
 jsonlines_concatenation :  This code performs line concatenation in JSONLines files. It aims to concatenate lines with IDs starting with 'eSc' into a single line.   
 
 jsonlines_split :   This code focuses on splitting a concatenated line in a JSON file and updating the lines accordingly.  
 
 operations_on_json_aligne_output :   The first cell of this notebook is a code designed to extract a specific field from a JSONLines file, with a focus on extracting aligned text passages. It is focused on extracting the aligned text passages generated by Passim in a JSONLines format  and concatenating them.  The second cell is a code designed to remove specific characters from the 'text' field in a JSON file.
